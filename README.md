# wormcells-notebooks
This repository collects all the notebooks and scripts used to wrangling C. elegans scRNAseq data and processing it with scvi-tools for the wormcells-viz and scdefg app 


Notebooks are examples and can be run on Google colab most of the time

For more information see https://wormbase.github.io/single-cell/

The data wrangling convention is described here: https://github.com/WormBase/single-cell/blob/main/data_wrangling_convention.md
